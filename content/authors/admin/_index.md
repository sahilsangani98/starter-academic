I'm recent computer science graduate from the University of Windsor. I love to play with data and discover underlying information within it. I'm looking for
opportunity in Software Developement / Data Science domain. I've successfully completed couple of internships, where I worked with technologies like Python, 
relational databases - SQL/MySQL/PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, REST APIs and cloud based services.
