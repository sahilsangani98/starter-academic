title: COVID - 19 Simulator
summary: The spread of COVID-19 simulation is created using MESA library in this project. As a reference, SIR mathematical model for virus spread is used, which is type of compartmental model to represent the growth of agents ( Here, Positive/Negative/Suspected People) based on the differential equations.
