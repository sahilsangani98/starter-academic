title: COVID-19 Dashboard
summary: COVID-19 dashboard provides information on COVID-19 cases status worldwide. It describes the daily number of cases, the top 10 countries by deaths and confirmed cases, and mortality rate. I have also included a heat map on the world to illustrates the most affected country by COVID-19.
