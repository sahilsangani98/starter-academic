Harnessing the power of Python, Google Cloud Storage, Mage ETL, BigQuery, and Looker, our project delves into Uber cab data analytics. By extracting, transforming, and loading data with Mage, we employ Google's ecosystem for storage and computation. Our BigQuery-driven data model comprehensively analyzes NYC's TLC trip records, revealing trends in pick-up/drop-off times, locations, distances, fares, payment types, and more. The Looker Studio dashboard visualizes these insights, providing an interactive exploration of the dataset's nuances.
