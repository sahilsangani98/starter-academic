title: Cataract Detection
summary: Cataract is the most widespread causes of blindness. Early detection or precautions could reduce the suffering from cataract to the patients and mitigate the visual disability from turning into total blindness. But the cost may cause difficulties to everybody’s early interventions, because the expertise trained eye specialists cannot be afforded by everyone. Based on the data provided on Kaggle.com, we are trying to build a model that predict whether the patient is suffering from cataract or not.
